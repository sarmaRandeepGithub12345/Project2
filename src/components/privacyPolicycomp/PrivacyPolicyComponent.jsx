          Information You Provide
        </p>
        <p className="">
          When you interact with our services, we collect information that you
          provide to us. For example, most of our services require you to set up
          a Helppert account, so we need to collect a few important details
          about you, such as your name, username, password, email address and
          date of birth. We may also ask you to provide us with some additional
          information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as a
          profile picture. Other services, such as commerce products, may
          require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its
          associated account information.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="">
          All users have no access to post content on helppert except those who
          convert their account to specialists or experts account by clicking
          the “Become Specialist” button on their profile. Rest all the users
          remain as visitors in the app.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When user wants to convert a account to specialists or expert’s
          account we ask few more details, such as Your specialization, your
          skills or talent description, country, SSN number, ID, Phone number,
          ID scan pictures, birth date, your skills certificate / course
          completion certificate, city, address, postal code, bank account name,
          currency and IBAN. We collect this information only if you are
          applying for a specialist account from a normal account. We will
          verify these details provided by you before we approve your account.
          We collect this information on behalf of Stripe Payment services &
          Cashfree payment aggregators to provide you safe payment services.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>

          services between our specialists and users.{" "}

        <p>
          Of course, you’ll also provide us with whatever information you send
          through our services, such as Posts and Chats. Keep in mind that the
          users who view your posts, Chats, and any other content can always
          save that content or copy it outside the Helppert app. So, the same
          common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to Helppert
          as well: Don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want
          someone to save or share.

          How Long We Keep Your Information

            We store your basic account information—like your name, phone
            number, and email address—and list of friends until you ask us to
            delete them.

            We store location information for different lengths of time based on
            how precise it is and which services you use. For example, if you
            use the discovery, we store information about your favourite
            searches for up to 30 days so we can personalise and improve your
            experience.

          we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve content, if we
